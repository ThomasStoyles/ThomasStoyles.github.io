								<p> Hey there, I'm Thomas Stoyles, currently studying the world of MSc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex. Trhoughout my journey I've been a frontend developer at a startup, using my skills to shape user experiences, leading to a project manager role.
									Additionally, I've delved into the world of QA as a consultant, ensuring top-notch quality across projects and creating some for clients. <br>
									<br>
									My passion for AI extends beyond the academic realm. In my spare moments, I've poured my energy into diverse projects, ranging from crafting simple yet 
									functional calculators to diving headfirst into the realm of voice-activated AI systems. <br>
									<br>
									Curiosity drives me, and my portfolio is a testament to this curiosityâ€”each project, a glimpse into my learning journey. 
									Take a peek around to explore my work and get to know more about my ventures into the fascinating realms of artificial intelligence and beyond. </p>

								<h2 class="major">University AI Work</h2>
								<p><i>Please note all projects are on my Github</i></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Uni.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/UoE-CE889">Module 1: Neural Networks</a> Within my university course we had to create a neural network without using libraries. This  was so that we learned how to implemenet 
									Feed-Forward Backpropagation. The task was to create neural network that played a simple python rocket game that landed the rocket on a randomly generated lander. The network would use 
									Feed-Forward Backpropagation with the inputs being X position to target and Y position to target. The outputs was the landers thruster and landers turning. To train the network, I 
									played the game on the "data collection" mode. This puts the inputs and outputs into a cvs file so it can be imported into the python file using pandas. Once in the cvs file I cleaned the data 
									and ran it through the network which I created so that we was able to get a RSME value. 
								</p>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/UoE-CE801">Module 2: Robotics</a> In a unstructured environment, the task involved programming the Turtlebot3 robot to complete key objectives. This included implementing a PID Controller 
									to enable a right edge following behavior and creating a fuzzy logic controller capable of executing both right edge following and obstacle avoidance behaviors. I also had to integrate 
									these behaviors within a unified fuzzy logic control structure, ensuring coordinated and effective functionality.
								</p>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/UoE-CE811">Module 3: Game artificial intelligence</a> Within this course I had complete mulitple challenges within the term and write a report on them, these was broken down into 2 seperate assignments.
									Here is a breakdown of the projects that needed to be completed and the link will take you to the completed reports and code.
									<b><br>Assignment 1</b>
									<i><br>DFS Maze generator
									<br>NeuralBot for The Resistance Game
									<br>Static Evaluator for Connect 4 
									<br>Minimax Algorithm for Connect 4
									<br>MCTS Agent for Connect 4</i>
									<br>
									<b><br>Assignment 2: Pacman Agents</b>
									<i><br>ManhattanGhostDodgerAgent
									<br>ManhattanGhostDodgerHunterAgent
									<br>One-Step Lookahead Agents
									<br>2 Dijkstra Algorithm Agents
									<br>Best possible Agent</i>
								</p>
								<p><a href="#">Module 4: Physics Based Games</a> This module had us creating a game based around physics, the game I choose was an Angry birds clone.
								Within this game I had to code gravity, thrust amongst other, which also had their own individual physics. I added some finishing touches such as a background
								and score to finish. 
								</p>
								</p>
								<p><a href="#">Module 5: Data Science</a> This module taught me how to use and display data in useful and meaningful ways. The brief for the coursework was to take
								weather data about Colchester and Brighton see how much renewable energy could be created through solar and wind power. With this information I had to declare how much 
								electricity we could provide to the cities for free and for how long. There was 2 parts to this work, part one was cleaning the data and presenting it in 
								meaningful ways through graphs and explaining how each graph helps me answer the question, along with research on how energy is produced. Part 2 was running the data 
								through different models to see which was the most accurate and to predict the energy generated based of the research conducted in the previous part.							 
								</p>
								</p>
								<p><a href="#">Module 6: Group Project</a> The group project completed by my team was </p>
								</p>
								<p><a href="#">Module 7: Dissertation(Mental Health Chatbot)</a> My dissertation is based on researching large language models and implementing a RAG system so I can specialize
								the model to answer questions about mental health in more detail than its pre-training. To do this I take text files that are stored in a FAISS database and get the model to respond
								to the user based on the context of these text files. The text files contain more accurate information than the pre-trained model, from a variety of sources. I then turned the model into
								a website for users to visit and interact with. <i>(Please note the website is currently not available, when it is the link will be added.)</i>

							<h2 class="major">Backend Work</h2>
							<p><i>Please note all projects are on my Github</i></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/backend.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/BorderlandsWeaponGen">Project 1: Borderlands weapon generator - </a> 
								This project was set out by an old employer QA. The project was to create an application that generate objects ranodmly. These objects was set upon predefined rules. 
								In this project the objects will create a random gun from the game Borderlands. This will give you a manufacturer, gun rarity and elemental damage. The project also
								had to be automated which was completed with Docker, Docker swarm, Jenkins and Ansible. All services was added to a virtual machine and tested with PyTest. Please see the documentaion 
								on the Github link for a more indepth analysis.
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/Voice_Activated_Assistant">Project 2: Voice activated AI</a> 
								Here I created my own voice activated AI that follows Alexa or Siri. This is a very basic shell of what can be done with it. It takes some python libaries
								and used them to listen to what you are saying through your microphone. what you have said what you need to it runs this through some if statements to see if
								it can match a word with insturctions. E.G. If your comment has the word time in it, it will tell you the time. Of course this can be developed further to include
								multiple questions that use teh word "time" but this hasn't been done as of yet.
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/QAProject">Project 3: QA CRUD Project</a>
								While at Qa they asked us to create a project so that they can show potential employers our work and skills. The breif was to create a CRUD project which uses both 
								HTML and Python to do the tasks required. These task was Create, Add, Delete and Update. Once copmleted I also added a Jenkins pipeline into the project to make sure that 
								the program was automaticlly tested whenever there was a commit via Github. Please see the documentaion on the Github link for a more indepth analysis.
							</p>
							<p><a href="https://github.com/ThomasStoyles/AI_Stock_Prediction">Project 4: AI Stock predictor</a> 
								This was one of the first AI's I created. This takes finance data from Yahoo.com as it tarining data and then predicts the stock in which you identify within the script.
								Here I have used Facebook which is known as FB as its stock. This is under the company variable.
